# Description of SEIR-MODEL to try to understand the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.

This attempt was born out of curiosity of what would be expected for Pullman, WA were I reside. I have since expanded it in collaboration with Ben Kerr

The pdf document contains an explanation of the choice for the parameter values that we have been using so far and some of the simpler SEIR models we have explored. The references are included in the document.

With the simple model you can already see what the effect of including mortality explicity in the model has on the dynamics, the effect of mitigation 30 days post introduction of the epidemic if transmission is reduced to 2/3 of its original value.

At the end of the document you can see the first lay out for a structured model. This model was modified to be able to change contact rates for each player individually and the most up to date version of the model can be found at [Ben Kerr's SEIR Risk](https://github.com/evokerr/SEIR_Risk_Model/)

I apologize for any typos, I appreciate any feedback.

An update and cleaner version of this code and explanation for a more general case will be posted sometime soon. We are trying to evaluate other scenarios
